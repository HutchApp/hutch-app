/**
 * Reachability filter for the stuck-articles canary.
 *
 * "Reachable" here means a basic HEAD probe receives any HTTP response. We do
 * not care about status codes — a 200, 404 or 503 all prove an origin server
 * answered, so the row stays in the canary report (the operator may still need
 * to ship a fix). "Unreachable" is reserved for the cases where `fetch()`
 * throws: DNS failure, TCP refused, TLS handshake error, timeout. Those rows
 * are not actionable and we drop them so the canary stops alarming on
 * `cd.home.arpa` and similar dead URLs.
 *
 * Native fetch only — no Cloudflare TLS-bypass chain. A site that blocks
 * native fetch but clears the crawler chain is one the prod crawler is
 * already reaching, so it would not be stuck in the first place.
